# AGISETI Demo using GNURadio

GNURadio is an open-source toolkit that provides signal processing blocks to implement software-defined radios (SDRs) and complex communication systems. Using graphical user interface (GUI) blocks, users can design and simulate systems without writing low-level code.
## Interferometry
Interferometry involves combining the signals from multiple antennas (often spaced far apart) to simulate a telescope with a much larger aperture. This technique allows researchers to achieve much higher resolution than possible with a single antenna. In this project, we will be observing and editing an already established GNURadio file that uses interferometry to analyze a signal.
